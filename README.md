## The Problem
As photographers, sometimes we get disappointed when we view our photos on a large screen. An image that we were convinced was crisp isn't so sharp when enlarged. To solve this, some people are using machine learning to re-create the image to add back the information lost by the blurr. There are applications available to correct photos. But what if we are speaking about video? There aren't so many options. 

To solve this problem, I propose to create a web-app that will apply a de-blurr operation to all the frames in a video.
